        <p class="speech">It will deal with the domestic industries of Brabant during the Middle
            Ages.</p>

        <h6 class="name missTesman">MISS TESMAN.</h6>
        <p class="speech">Fancy--to be able to write on such a subject as that!</p>

        <h6 class="name tesman">TESMAN.</h6>
        <p class="speech">However, it may be some time before the book is ready. I have all these
            collections to arrange first, you see.</p>

        <h6 class="name missTesman">MISS TESMAN.</h6>
        <p class="speech">Yes, collecting and arranging--no one can beat you at that. There you
            are my poor brother's own son.</p>

        <h6 class="name tesman">TESMAN.</h6>
        <p class="speech">I am looking forward eagerly to setting to work at it; especially now
            that I have my own delightful home to work in.</p>

        <h6 class="name missTesman">MISS TESMAN.</h6>
        <p class="speech">And, most of all, now that you have got the wife of your heart, my dear
            George.</p>

        <p class="direction">[Embracing her.]</p> <p class="speech"> yes, yes, Aunt Julia! Hedda--she is the best part of
            it all! I believe I hear her coming--eh?<br>
          HEDDA enters from the left through the inner room.  Her face
            and figure show refinement and distinction.  Her complexion
            is pale and opaque.  Her steel-grey eyes express a cold,
            unruffled repose.  Her hair is of an agreeable brown, but
            not particularly abundant.  She is dressed in a tasteful,
            somewhat loose-fitting morning gown.</p>

        <h6 class="name missTesman">MISS TESMAN.</h6>
        <p class="direction">[Going to meet HEDDA.]</p> <p class="speech">Good morning, my dear Hedda! Good morning, and a
            hearty welcome!</p>

        <h6 class="name hedda">HEDDA.</h6>
        <p class="direction">[Holds out her hand.]</p> <p class="speech">Good morning, dear Miss Tesman! So early a call!
            That is kind of you.</p>
