        <p>TESMAN.</p>
        <p>Have you heard anything of Eilert? Since I went away, I mean.</p>

        <p>MISS TESMAN.</p>
        <p>Only that he is said to have published a new book.</p>

        <p>TESMAN.</p>
        <p>What! Eilert Lovborg! Recently--eh?</p>

        <p>MISS TESMAN.</p>
        <p>Yes, so they say. Heaven knows whether it can be worth anything! Ah,
            when your new book appears--that will be another story, George! What is
            it to be about?</p>

        <p>TESMAN.</p>
        <p>It will deal with the domestic industries of Brabant during the Middle
            Ages.</p>

        <p>MISS TESMAN.</p>
        <p>Fancy--to be able to write on such a subject as that!</p>

        <p>TESMAN.</p>
        <p>However, it may be some time before the book is ready. I have all these
            collections to arrange first, you see.</p>

        <p>MISS TESMAN.</p>
        <p>Yes, collecting and arranging--no one can beat you at that. There you
            are my poor brother's own son.</p>

        <p>TESMAN.</p>
        <p>I am looking forward eagerly to setting to work at it; especially now
            that I have my own delightful home to work in.</p>

        <p>MISS TESMAN.</p>
        <p>And, most of all, now that you have got the wife of your heart, my dear
            George.</p>

        <p>TESMAN.</p>
        <p>[Embracing her.] Oh yes, yes, Aunt Julia! Hedda--she is the best part of
            it all! I believe I hear her coming--eh?<br>
          HEDDA enters from the left through the inner room.  Her face
            and figure show refinement and distinction.  Her complexion
            is pale and opaque.  Her steel-grey eyes express a cold,
            unruffled repose.  Her hair is of an agreeable brown, but
            not particularly abundant.  She is dressed in a tasteful,
            somewhat loose-fitting morning gown.</p>

        <p>MISS TESMAN.</p>
        <p>[Going to meet HEDDA.] Good morning, my dear Hedda! Good morning, and a
            hearty welcome!</p>

        <p>HEDDA.</p>
        <p>[Holds out her hand.] Good morning, dear Miss Tesman! So early a call!
            That is kind of you.</p>

        <p>MISS TESMAN.</p>
        <p>[With some embarrassment.] Well--has the bride slept well in her new
            home?</p>
